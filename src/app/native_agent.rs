//! The built-in agent's model catalog, taken from the signed-in account.
//!
//! Every CLI provider discovers its models by being asked; the daemon runs
//! `codex app-server` or `claude --list-models` and reads the answer. The
//! built-in agent has no command to ask, and what it can actually reach is
//! decided by the account it routes through — so its catalog is the gateway
//! listing the Model Plaza page shows, every platform of it, and lands in the
//! provider probe the picker already reads.
//!
//! The id carries the model's family ahead of a `::` (`deepseek::…`), one
//! row per model however many groups serve it. The key it goes out with is
//! not the id's business: the routing writer files one per model, from the
//! group [`sub2api::model_routing`] picked for it, and the family only
//! decides the fallback. The picker never shows an id, only the name and the
//! brand-and-platform subtitle — which also names the subscription a model
//! goes through, when it goes through one.
//!
//! The wire format — Anthropic Messages, OpenAI Responses, OpenAI Chat
//! Completions — is a property of the model, and each model has exactly one.
//! Claude is served over Messages; the GPT and Grok families over Responses;
//! DeepSeek, Kimi, GLM and MiniMax over Chat Completions. A model belonging
//! to none of those is not offered at all — there is no API to send it over,
//! so listing it would only promise something that fails.
//!
//! The models a user declared on an endpoint of their own are listed too,
//! every endpoint under its own name, as `custom:<provider id>::<model>`
//! ([`native_endpoint_models`]). No rule reads those names: they go to that
//! endpoint in the format it declared, with the key it holds.
//!
//! That one format lands in the model's "service tier" slot, which is what
//! the composer's traits menu names. The picker does not file the list by
//! it: people look for DeepSeek, not for Chat Completions, so its column
//! groups the models by vendor ([`native_vendor_of`]) and the format simply
//! rides along with whichever model is picked.
//!
//! Pure mapping plus the hooks that apply it; the fetch is the Plaza's.
